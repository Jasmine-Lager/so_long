## About

so_long is a simple 2D game where the player must collect all collectibles on the map and reach the exit with the minimum number of moves. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and focuses on window management, event handling, textures, and basic gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- ✨ 2D tile-based rendering
- 🎮 Smooth player movement
- 🎯 Collectible items system
- 🗺️ Custom map support
- 📊 Move counter display
- ✅ Map validation system
- 🎨 Custom sprites and textures

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Make
- MiniLibX library (included in most 42 School environments)

### Build

Clone the repository and compile the project:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd so_long
make
```

This will create the `so_long` executable.

### Clean

```bash
make clean   # Remove object files
make fclean  # Remove object files and executable
make re      # Recompile everything
```

## Usage

Run the game with a valid map file:

```bash
./so_long maps/map.ber
```

Replace `map.ber` with the path to your desired map file.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` or `↑` | Move up |
| `A` or `←` | Move left |
| `S` or `↓` | Move down |
| `D` or `→` | Move right |
| `ESC` | Exit game |

## Map Format

Maps are stored in `.ber` files with the following components:

- `1` - Wall
- `0` - Empty space
- `C` - Collectible
- `E` - Exit
- `P` - Player starting position

### Map Rules

- Map must be rectangular and surrounded by walls (`1`)
- Must contain exactly one exit (`E`)
- Must contain exactly one starting position (`P`)
- Must contain at least one collectible (`C`)
- Must have a valid path from player to all collectibles and exit

### Example Map

```
111111
1P0C01
100001
1C00E1
111111
```
